## #201 - How do I add a collaborator to my project?

1. Click the Projects link in the menu bar.
2. Click on the project you would like to add a collaborator.
3. Scroll down on the project page to the **Sharing** section and enter your collaborators email under Librarians or Members.
4. Your collaborator will receive an email with a link that will add the collaborator to the project. The collaborator will need to sign up first in order to be successfully added to the project.

### NOTE: You can add a collaborator to a site if you want to allow them to only see subjects from that site instead of adding them as a project librarian or member.

## #202 - What is the difference between a project librarian and a project member?

Project Librarians can do everything on a project that the project owner can including:

* Adding and removing collaborators from the project
* Creating designs, variables, sheets
* View everything on the project

Project Members

* Create and update data collection sheets
* CANNOT modify designs or variables
* View everything on the project

## #203 - Can I assign specific permissions for collaborators on my project?

Slice allows scoping by site. If you only want a collaborator to be able to view a subset of subjects, add them to the site they should have access to instead of adding them to the project itself.
