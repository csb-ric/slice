## #301 - How do I create a new design?

1. Select your project from the project splash page.
2. Scroll down and select the **Designs**.
3. On the Designs Index, click **Create Design**.
4. From here you can specify certain features about your design.


### Adding sections to your design

You can add a section by editing your design and clicking **Add Section**. You will then be prompted to enter a section name, and an optional section description. Sections are used to generate the navigation submenu that can be seen when entering a new sheet for the design. You can also add a page break before a section to split a long form across multiple pages.

Further information on more **Design Section options**.


### Adding existing variables to your design

You can add a variable by editing your design and clicking **Add Variable**. You can then select the variable from a dropdown, and also specify the [branching logic](/slice/faq/300-designs/305-variable-design-branching-logic).

### Adding new variables to your design

You can add a new variable by editing your design and clicking **Add Variable**. You can then select **Create Variable** which will show a dialog allowing you to create a new variable that will be inserted into the existing design.
