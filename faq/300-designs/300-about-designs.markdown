## #300 - What is a design?

A design is a template for capturing data. Designs are composed primarily of two components, sections and variables.

**Sections** allows a form to group similar variables together, and is also used to enable easier navigation across larger designs.

** Variables** are usually questions or input fields that can be specified in a flexible format depending on how the researcher would like to capture the data on the form. While variables can **only be added once** to a design, it is possible to create a **grid variable** that is composed of multiple variables. A description of grid variables can be seen in [our blog post](https://sleepepi.partners.org/2012/09/10/reading-center-interface-0-7-0-grid-variables-and-multi-page-designs/).

### More Variable options

1. Data is kept consistent even if variables are updated and changed after data is already captured.
2. Missing options are handled separately from regular options and can be filtered on using reports [blog post](https://sleepepi.partners.org/2012/07/10/reading-center-interface-0-4-0-capturing-variable-nuances/).
