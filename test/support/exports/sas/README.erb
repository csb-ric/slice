SAS IMPORT FILES
================

    This folder includes files required to import data into
    a SAS data set. The main file, `dataset_sas.sas`,
    contains variable and design definitions that are used
    to label the captured data within SAS.

    YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY
        LINE 8
    TO POINT TO THE APPROPRIATE FOLDER THAT CONTAINS
    THE `_raw.csv` FILES

    Example, change LINE 8 from:

        %let import_folder      = C: ;

    to:

        %let import_folder      = C:\Users\**username**\Downloads\SAS ;


    Make sure you unzip the downloaded `.zip` before attempting to
    import into SAS.


RAW DATASET FILES
=================

    The `_raw.csv` dataset files contain the actual data
    values captured across various subjects and sheets.
