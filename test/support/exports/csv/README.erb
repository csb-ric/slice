Variables and Grids
===================

    Slice collects data for all subjects on the sheet level.
    A single variable can only be collected once per sheet,
    per subject, unless the variable is included in a grid.
<% if include_grids? %>    Since variables in grids can be collected more than once
    for an individual sheet (such as medications), these data
    are stored in a separate CSV file with the name `_grids`
    included in the file name.<% end %>


RAW and Labeled
===============

    CSV files can be formatted to include the data value captured
    `_raw`, or to include the description of the data collected
    `_labeled`.

    RAW CSVs are typically used for further programmatic analysis,
    and can be more easily be consumed by other programs that may
    use the CSV file as an input file.

    Labeled CSVs are intended for easier viewing and filtering in
    a spreadsheet program by humans, as the label is included in
    the result. Labeled CSVs are easier to view and interpret for
    humans.
