  %p
    Slice provides a simple syntax to quickly filter subjects and sheets.
    Multiple filters can be combined to find subjects and sheets matching the
    criteria.

  %p
    %strong Usage:
  %p
    %code variable:value
  %p
    %strong Example:
  %code{ style: 'text-align: right;' } bmi:missing grade:9,10 study_visit:>=2016-10-10 study_visit:<=2016-10-14

  %h3 Operators
  %p
    Sheets and subjects can be filtered by providing values and operators along
    with the variable of interest.
    For example
    %code bmi:23.0
    finds all sheets that have a BMI equal to
    = succeed '.' do
      %strong 23.0
    To find a BMI greater than or equal to
    %strong 23.0
    the filter can be written as
    = succeed '.' do
      %code bmi:>=23.0
    The following operators work as well.
    %code bmi:>23.0
    %code bmi:<23.0
    %code bmi:<=23.0

  %h3 Multiple Values
  %p
    Use commas to separate values to filter by multiple values.
    Do not put spaces between the values and commas.
    The filter
    %code grade=9,10,11,12
    will return results where the
    %code grade
    equals
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong 9
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong 10
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong 11
    or
    = succeed '.' do
      %strong 12

  %h3 Not Equal
  %p
    Use the
    %code !=
    operator to filter results where BMI does not equal
    %strong 23.0
    Ex:
    %code bmi:!=23.0

  %h3 Dates
  %p
    Dates can also be compared using these operators. For example the following
    provides results with a
    %strong study_visit
    on or after October 14, 2016:
    %code study_visit:>=2016-10-14

  %h2 Special Values

  %p
    Special Values:
    = succeed ',' do
      %code :entered
    = succeed ',' do
      %code :any
    = succeed ',' do
      %code :missing
    = succeed '.' do
      %code :unentered

  %h3 Entered / Present
  %p
    The
    %code :entered
    and
    %code :present
    keywords find sheets that have data entered for a variable.
    These filters find sheets with actual values
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong 23.0
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong 0.0
    as well as entered missing codes
    = succeed '.' do
      %strong -9

  %h3 Any
  %p
    The
    %code :any
    keyword finds sheets that have a value entered for a variable
    that is NOT a missing code. The example
    %code bmi:any
    returns sheets that have values
    %strong 23.0
    and
    = succeed '.' do
      %strong 0.0

  %h3 Missing
  %p
    The
    %code :missing
    keyword finds sheets that have missing codes or are unentered.
    The example
    %code bmi:missing
    returns sheets that have missing code values
    %strong -9
    and sheets that have no values entered for BMI.

  %h3 Unentered / Blank
  %p
    The
    %code :unentered
    and
    %code :blank
    keywords find sheets that have no values entered for a variable.
    The example
    %code bmi:unentered
    returns sheets that have no values entered for BMI.

  %h3 Checks
  %p
    For projects that have
    = link_to 'checks', docs_checks_path
    setup, sheets can be filtered as follow:
  %p
    To filter on sheets that are failing a check, type:
    %code checks:any
  %p
    To filter on a single check, type:
    %code= "checks:<b>NAME</b>".html_safe
    where NAME is the check name.

  %h3 Events
  %p
    For projects that have
    = link_to 'events', docs_events_path
    setup, sheets can be filtered as follow:
  %p
    To filter on sheets on an event, type:
    %code events:any
  %p
    To filter sheets not on an event, type:
    %code events:missing
  %p
    To filter on a single event, type:
    %code= "events:<b>NAME</b>".html_safe
    where NAME is the event name.

  %h3 Adverse Events

  %p
    To filter sheets related to adverse events, type:

    %code has:adverse-events

  %h3 Comments

  %p
    To filter sheets that have comments, type:

    %code has:comments

  %h3 File Attachments

  %p
    To filter sheets that have an attached file, type:

    %code has:files

  %h3 Time Duration

  %p
    Time duration is stored in total seconds. To filter sheets by duration
    greater than 1 hour, type:

    %code :>3600
    %code :>3600s
    %code :>60m
    %code :>1h

  %h3 Imperial Height
  %p
    Imperial height is stored in total inches. To filter sheets by height
    greater than or equal to 6 feet, type:

    %code :>=72
    %code :>=72in
    %code :>=6ft

  %h3 Imperial Weight
  %p
    Imperial weight is stored in total ounces. To filter sheets by weight less
    than or equal to 4 pounds, type:

    %code :<=64
    %code :<=64oz
    %code :<=4lb

  %h3 Completion Coverage Percent
  %p
    Sheets can be filtered by their completion percent. Use
    %code missing
    to find sheets that haven't had their coverage computed.

    %code coverage:<80
    %code coverage:>=60
    %code coverage:missing

  %h3 Multiple Variables
  %p
    To find results where BMI is missing and grade is either 9 or 10, and a
    study visit during the week of October 10, 2016 use the following set of
    filters. Filters should be separated by a space.
  %code{ style: 'text-align: right;' } bmi:missing grade:9,10 study_visit:>=2016-10-10 study_visit:<=2016-10-14
