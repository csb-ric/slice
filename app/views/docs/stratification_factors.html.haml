    Setting stratification factors allows similar groups of subjects to be
    present across all treatment arms. For example, you may wish to study the
    role biological sex plays on a particular treatment. In this case, the study
    may make observations and comparisons between females in one treatment arm
    to another treatment arm. A Case/Control study is a good example of this.

  %p
    The study may also be interested in the effects of the treatment based on
    weight as well. In this case a second stratification factor, for example
    Body Mass Index, may be added.

  %p
    Both Biological Sex and Body Mass Index, would need to be split into
    discrete groups. These groups, called stratification factor options, could
    be Male and Female, and "BMI less than 20", "BMI 20 to 30", and "BMI greater
    than 30".

  %p
    To ensure an even distribution across sites, a "Stratify By Site",
    stratification option is also available.

  %p
    If you are using Permuted-block algorithm, increasing the number of
    stratification factors increases the number of subjects that need to be
    randomized to ensure even distributions across treatment arms. A better
    option in this case may be to use the Minimization algorithm instead, which
    handles distributions by stratification factors dynamically instead of
    relying on a precomputed list.
