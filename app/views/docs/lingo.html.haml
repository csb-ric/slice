    Variables can be single choice responses, multi-choice, free text, times,
    numbers, calculations, and can also be signatures and file uploads.

  %h2 Domains

    %code Choices
    %code.nowrap Discrete Data

    A domain is a predefined and finite set of choices. A domain can belong to
    multiple questions, for example a "Yes or No" domain, or it may be specific
    to a single question.
