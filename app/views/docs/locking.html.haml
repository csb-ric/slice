    In certain cases, data entry adjustments may be made to an existing sheet
    some time after the initial data entry. Projects can set a length of time
    that a sheet stays editable before automatically locking. A locked sheet
    can no longer be edited. In order to make changes on a locked sheet, an
    site editor must request the sheet to be unlocked for further editing and
    provide a reason for the changes. This request can be approved or rejected
    by project editors.
