      %strong Capturing Data
    Or better yet,
    = succeed '.' do
      %strong Creating a Data Capture Form
    Or perhaps
    = succeed ',' do
      %strong Designing a Data Capture Form
    because in part, good data capture is an art form.

    Slice, for better or for worse, likes to encapsulate larger concepts using
    single words.

  %h2 What is a Design?

  %p
    A design is composed of a series of questions that can be grouped into
    sections. The purpose of a design is to capture a set of data points, and
    provides the framework to faithfully capture the data.

  %p
    A good understanding of the formats of questions that Slice provides is
    important to creating a good design. While Slice provides the tools to make
    robust designs, it is still possible to create designs that poorly represent
    the underlying data. This disconnect typically results from a lack of
    understanding of the reporting and analysis of the data after it is
    collected.

  %p
    It is important to know the eventual analysis of the data while creating a
    design.

  %h2 Creating a design.

  %p
    A design primarily consists of a list of questions. Each question (commonly
    referred to as a variable in Slice), has a display name, along with a variable
    name. The
    %strong variable name
    is used to facilitate analysis of data exports, as
    well as setting up calculations and data quality checks. The
    %strong display name
    is what is shown the the user entering the data.

  %p
    Slice provides a number of variable
    %strong types
    that can be used to capture data in different formats. These variable types
    are covered in detail in the
    = link_to 'Variables', docs_variables_path
    section, but can cover single choice responses, free text, numbers, times,
    and dates.

  %p
    For long designs, it is useful to split the questions into sections.
    Sections can be added to designs, and can contain a heading, as well as a
    section description.

  %p
    Designs can only be created and modified by project editors. Project
    viewers, site editors, and site viewers do not have access to the design

    builder.
