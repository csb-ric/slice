  %p
    Slice provides two types of randomization algorithms,
    %strong Minimization
    and
    %strong Permuted-Block
    algorithms.

    These algorithms impact how the randomization lists are generated. The
    following describes the differences between the two algorithms.

  %p
    If you don't have specific requirements for your randomization, Slice
    recommends the use of the Minimization algorithm as it will generate a more
    equal distribution as the number stratification factors increases
    (especially for studies with low numbers of participants), and takes less
    time to set up.
